# Convofy

Convofy is an open-source movie and TV trailer watching platform. Our mission is to make the trailer-watching experience more interactive and engaging. We believe in the power of conversation and aim to make Convofy the ultimate hub for trailer talk.

## Why Convofy?

At Convofy, we wanted to create a platform that would bring together the best of both worlds: the excitement of watching trailers and the community of movie and TV show enthusiasts. We wanted to create a platform where users could watch trailers together, join live audio conversations, and connect with like-minded individuals. It wasn't just about watching trailers; it was about experiencing them together.
